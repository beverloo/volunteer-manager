        'difference could be a barrier for new volunteers to sign up.',

    application:

        '2023 would be considered at 50% if half the volunteers participated again in either ' +
        '2024 or 2025. Our thesis is that volunteers who are treated well and enjoy what they ' +
        'are doing are more likely to participate again.',
